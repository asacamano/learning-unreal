# Learning Unreal

Information I'm collecting as I learn to make a game in Unreal Engine 5.

## Tools used in building this site

## GitHub

Obvious, and very important. +100

## Reveal.js for slides

[Reveal JS](https://revealjs.com/).

How I got it working:

* Download the ZIP file per https://revealjs.com/installation/#basic-setup.
* Copy the `dist` and `plugins` directories from the zip file to this directory.
* Include the [Markdown plugin](https://revealjs.com/markdown/).
* I used the [Sky theme](https://revealjs.com/themes/).
