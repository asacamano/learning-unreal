# Learning Unreal

Information I'm collecting as I learn to make a game in Unreal Engine 5.

## Presentation

I shared [this](things_im_learning_learning_unreal.html) with colleagues at work.

## Documentation

My must-read, keep coming back to it Unreal documentation:

* Marcos Romero's [Blueprints Compendium Vol 1,2,3](https://romeroblueprints.blogspot.com/p/table-of-contents.html)
* Cedric Neukirchen's [Network Compendium](https://cedric-neukirchen.net/)


## Tools used in building this site

## GitHub

Obvious, and very important. +100

* Follow the GitHub Pages [Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

## Reveal.js for slides

[Reveal JS](https://revealjs.com/).

How I got it working:

* Download the ZIP file per https://revealjs.com/installation/#basic-setup.
* Copy the `dist` and `plugins` directories from the zip file to this directory.
* Include the [Markdown plugin](https://revealjs.com/markdown/).
* I used the [Sky theme](https://revealjs.com/themes/).
