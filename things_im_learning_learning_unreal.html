## ...making a game is a lot of work

Note:

We could just end there, but maybe people want to know a bit more.

About a six months ago I set out to make a game.
* I was lured by newly released Unreal Engine 5.
* It made real-time photorealistic environments available on average hardware.
* Like this: 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_YtgBtLNeg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Note:

It is a simple game. But I wanted it to be graphically very beautiful and lush and rich - and photorealistic.
---
Bonus: Unreal has [friendly](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/faq)
[licencing]((https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/license)) terms...

> *A 5% royalty is due only if you are distributing an off-the-shelf product
> that incorporates Unreal Engine code (such as a game) and the lifetime gross
> revenue from that product exceeds $1 million USD; in this case, the first $1
> million remains royalty-exempt.*

I'm not going to make a million dollars from this, so... it's free!

Note:

Compare this to Unity - which is another very popular choice:

* Free, but limit supported platforms with the free version.
* More to the point, you have to pay $40 / mo to get your own
  splash screen... 
* Up to $200K annual revenue / funding - then you got to $180 mo.

I didn't want to pay a subscription for a hobby I might suck at. And I didn't 
expect to make money, but maybe?
---
Comparing Unreal with [Unity](https://unity.com/) (the main alternative).

* Both Unreal and Unity have lots of free content.
* Both can do really realistic scenes - Unreal might be better at *big* realistic scenes.
* Both have marketplaces with lots of assets to buy.
* Unity has good docs.  Unreal is a bit more like... "try it, you'll figure it out ;)"
* Unity is game focused. Unreal also supports has VFX, Architecture, Automotive Design.

Note: I don't read manuals that much anyway...
---
Read these docs:

* Marcos Romero's [Blueprints Compendium Vol 1,2,3](https://romeroblueprints.blogspot.com/p/table-of-contents.html)
* Cedric Neukirchen's [Network Compendium](https://cedric-neukirchen.net/)


Note:

These sources are quite to-the-point, and reasonably short. I would recommend just reading them.

The Unreal docs are just as bad as everyone says.  They're good if you already know what
you're doing, but really hard as a beginner.
---
Also - YouTube is your friend. There's a lot of good content on YouTube.  

I especially like these channels on YouTube:

* [Unreal Engine Official](https://www.youtube.com/@UnrealEngine)
* [William Faucher](https://www.youtube.com/@WilliamFaucher)
* [Unreal Sensei](https://www.youtube.com/@UnrealSensei)

And I liked this instructor on Udemy:

* [Gavin Eisen](https://www.udemy.com/user/gavin-eisenbeisz/?src=sac&kw=Gavin+Eisenbeisz)


Note:

There's there's also a lot of very low-quality stuff.

And some of the free content is "look how quickly an expert can do this - and I'll show you 80% of the steps."

# Surprises
---
Finding a good 3D workflow is tricky. No tool solves all the parts easily for novice users:

* **Modeling**: Blender, Unreal, AutoCAD, SketchUp, Adobe
* **Texturing**: Blender, Quixel Mixer, Armour Paint, Adobe
* **Animation**: Blender, a bunch of stuff I don't know.

But interoperability is not smooth.

Note:

Interoperability is not guaranteed, standards are there, but they are very much lowest-common-denominator, and
the pro market drives this.  Hobby work is definitely an afterthought.

Specifically, I spent several days learning to get beautiful objects in Blender, only to realize that 90% of
the work I did in Blender could not be exported into Unreal (even with the dedicated plugins).

It all comes down to a the rendering engine.
---
Each Game engine, and Blender, and other tools, has their own rendering engine / pipeline / process. 

* It is part of their competitive advantage.
* Basic 3D meshes models work fine across all.
* Some parts of texturing work OK, but they each model light and materials differently.
* They each have "magical" features that are really useful, but incompatible with the others.

---
I used Upwork to hire some help - and was really happy with how it worked out.

* I used the logic of "What would I pay a college student in Munich for this?"
* I got plenty of bids.
* It was a small project, so I asked three people to each do it.
* None of the results were bad, but one really stood out - so I'm going to keep working with them.
---
Sound is more straightforward - the formats are more standard.

But sound in games is tricky.

* With a movie, there is "off-camera". In a game, if you can hear it, it needs to be in the scene.
* When the player controls the narrative, repetition is more obvious.

Note:

So a lot of commercially available samples might not work well in games.
---
Unreal has 2 programming models: C++ and Blueprints.

* Blueprints use a "dataflow" programming paradigm.
* C++ is C++ (kind of...)

Note:

I expected 3D graphics and sound to be hard - I'm a total noob.  But even programming took me by surprise.
---
Blueprints:

![Blueprint example showing a branch](things_im_learning_learning_unreal_images/blueprints.png)

Note:

This shows the camera being raised and lowered as the player stands or sits.
* ToggleSit is an event.
* "Sitting" is a variable.
* The white lines are "control" lines - things activate when the control line is "active".

---
More Blueprints:

![Blueprint example showing a sequence](things_im_learning_learning_unreal_images/blueprints_2.png)

Note:

This shows:
* cleaning up the current phase, if it exists
* incrementing a counter (if there is more to do)
* starting the new phase.

It took me a while to realize that without the sequence operator, order of execution is undefined.

References to variables are actually by reference.

---
Blueprints pros:

* Super quick and easy to write and debug for simple wiring jobs.
* Error handling is easy - ignore it (mostly).
* Really quick code / test cycle.

Blueprints cons

* Not text based, can't diff versions.
* Can be tricky, big, and hard-to-read for complex logic.

---
Unreal C++ is not quite standard C++.

I suspect this is because: 

* Need to ship on Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, XBox, Playstation.
* Should never, never, never, never crash.

Therefor:

* No `new` , `malloc`, or `free`.
* No stdlib, or any other C++ standard library.
* No [statics](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/static-variables-possible/6841).
* No [exceptions](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/how-can-i-enable-unwind-semantics-for-c-style-exceptions/284934).
* Little things: "== null" is not useful - you need a special "isValid" function.
---
C++ Example:

![C++ example showing some string handling](things_im_learning_learning_unreal_images/cplusplus.png)

Note:

* Custom array class.
* Custom string types and methods.
* Two kinds of string (localizable and not)
* etc...
---
C++ pros:

* It's C++ - you can do just about anything.
* Some of the API is only available to C++.
* "Live coding" but only for some kinds of changes.

C++ cons:

* Not standard C++.
* There's a complex build chain, it only works with Visual Studio (VS Code Support is in beta, it didn't work for me.)

Note:

There's a bunch of custom header and project generation and pre-processing. I could never get that to work in VS Code.

Pick a style guide and follow it - I use https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/recommended-asset-naming-conventions-in-unreal-engine-projects/,
https://github.com/Allar/ue5-style-guide.
---
Blueprints seem to be [more popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/10bsyk4/are_you_using_blueprints_or_c/).

* You can use either or [both](https://unrealcommunity.wiki/mixing-blueprints-and-cpp-8keheovh) in a project.
* You can "switch" between them pretty easily.
---
Testing

I haven't found a real "unit test" tool. But there are some automated tests:

* You can run "behavioral" tests in-game, control a player and make it do things.
* You can make dedicated "testing levels".

---
Unreal is not a library. It's a framework.

If you don't do things the "Unreal" way, you're going to have a bad time.

[![Upgoer 5 Detail from XKCD](things_im_learning_learning_unreal_images/upgoer_detail.png)](https://xkcd.com/1133/)
---
No such thing as single-player.

* My game is really targeting single-player mode.
* But Unreal is very much multi-player.
* If you don't know how Unreal handles multi-player - which things are on the server,
 which on the client, and how they communicate - lots of things just don't work.

 So basically, you need to learn the multi-player model, and then write a single-player
 mode.

# Final thoughts
---
### Prototype first.

Polished graphics take a lot of work, and might be hard to reuse.

Note:
---
### Freelancers are your friends.

Until you're really an expert, it's so easier to pay for something than to make it.
---
### Asset libraries are cheaper than freelancers.

Even professionals prefer buying from a library than building from scratch.
---
### Know why you are making a game.

It's a [huge time sync](https://www.engadget.com/2015-02-06-the-witness-money.html).
It's a [terrible career move](https://www.wired.com/2021/05/geeks-guide-jason-schreier/).
Figure out what you want to get out of it, and focus on that.
